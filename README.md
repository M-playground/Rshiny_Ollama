# LLM model with R shiny 

### /Generate_Ollama/modified_shiny_ollama.R
The sole purpose of this application is to generate responses (one-time) using the open-source AI LLM framework, ollama, and to explore its capabilities.

This modification serves as a template preluding the implementation of the "Chat" concept (memorizing the previous chat history) in the program. The entire code base originates from 'https://github.com/TroyHernandez/shiny_ollama' and has been adapted for a more general purpose.
